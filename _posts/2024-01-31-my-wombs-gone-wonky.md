My womb’s gone wonky  
But I can’t tell you how  
Because I haven’t been given the language  
To talk about it  

	*It is best not to teach  
	People with wombs  
	How their wombs work  
	Because people with wombs  
	Find it hard to understand  
	How things work*  

My womb’s gone wonky  
Perhaps it’s The Change  
…into what?  
Do I get to choose?!  

*It is best not to allow  
People with wombs  
To choose things  
Because people with wombs  
Will only go and choose  
The wrong things*  

My womb’s gone wonky  
Should I turn it off and on again?  
I tried to check the manual  
But it’s password protected.  

*It is best not to encourage  
People with wombs  
To fiddle with the hardware  
Because they’ll only break it*  

My womb’s gone wonky.  
But the symptoms on this leaflet  
Sound remarkably like the things I might experience  
On an unremarkable Tuesday in June  

*It is best not to prioritise  
People with wombs  
When doing research  
It is much safer to ask  
People without wombs  
How they feel  
About wombs*  

My womb’s gone wonky  
And my eyes  
And my boobs  
And my joints  
And my muscles  
And my skin  
Any my mood  
And my sex drive  
And my sleep  
And it isn’t fair to sweat this much and still put on weight.  

My womb’s gone wonky  
And suddenly a society that seemed  
Overly concerned with what I do with it  
Is avoiding eye contact and shuffling its feet  

My womb’s gone won–  
Hang on, if you don’t want it anymore…  
*…can I have it back now?*
