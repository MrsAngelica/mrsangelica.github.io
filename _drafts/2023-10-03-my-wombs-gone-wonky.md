My womb's gone wonky
But I can't explain how
Because I was never given the language
To talk about it

You see, it is best not to expect
People with wombs
To know things about their wombs
Because their wombs
Make it difficult
To know things

My womb's gone wonky
I've tried turning it off and on again
But it took a long time to reboot
And all the buttons have moved

Yes, yes, I've looked at the manual
But there's no troubleshooting section...
Just a lot of stuff about
How to make it look and feel nice
For other people

My womb's gone wonky
I think it's probably The Change
But into what?
Do *I* get to choose?

My womb's gone wonky
As well as
My eyes
My boobs
My joints
My muscles
My skin
My mood
My sex drive
And my sleep

And I'm SO ANGRY

And I'm sweating more than I ever did when I went to the gym...
(That one time)
...but I'm still putting on weight

My womb's gone wonky
But the 35 'symptoms' on this pamphlet they gave me
Sound remarkably like the things I might experience
On an unremarkable Tuesday in June

My womb's gone wonky
And, honestly, I'm a bit pissed off
Because I was just starting
To understand it

My womb's gone wonky
And suddenly a society that seemed overly concerned
With what I do with it
Is avoiding eye contact
And shuffling its feet

But wait...

Now that it's wonky
Is it finally *all mine*?
