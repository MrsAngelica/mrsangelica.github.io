# Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome...

(Less an attempt at a multilingual blog, more a shameless *Cabaret* reference)

If this is your first time here, hello!  Generally speaking, I blog about [(twin) parenting](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/tags/parenting/), [feminism](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/tags/feminism/), [yoga](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/tags/yoga/), [mindfulness](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/tags/mindfulness/) and [(armchair) psychology](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/tags/psychology/) (NB I'm using "psychology" as a clumsy shorthand for "general stuff about how the brain works and/or how people see, and interact with, the world).

[Here's](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/2021/04/06/who-am-i/) a kind of introduction to who I am and the kind of thing you might find here.

If you would like to comment on/discuss anything you read here, or else communicate with me through the medium of limited characters, [you can find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpnParenthesis).

Otherwise, come on in, grab a cup of tea (and at least three biscuits) and consider yourself very welcome :)

xx
