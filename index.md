# Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome...

(Less an attempt at a multilingual blog, more a shameless *Cabaret* reference)

Latest post: [Who am I? (Or "I'm sure I left my identity around here somewhere"](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/2021/04/06/who-am-i/)

If this is your first time here, hello!  At the bottom of every page are links to lists of posts with certain tags, for example [(twin) parenting](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/tags/parenting/) and [(yoga and) mindfulness](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/tags/mindfulness/).

[Here's](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/2021/04/06/who-am-i/) a kind of introduction to the blog and [here's](https://openparenthesis.co.uk/2021/04/06/) a kind of introduction to me and the sort of thing you might find here.

If you would like to comment on/discuss anything you read here, or else communicate with me through the medium of limited characters, [you can find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpnParenthesis).

Otherwise, come on in, grab a cup of tea (and at least three biscuits) and consider yourself very welcome :)

xx
