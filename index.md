# Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome...

(Less an attempt at a multilingual blog, more a shameless *Cabaret* reference)

Latest post: [Who am I? (Or "I'm sure I left my identity around here somewhere"]({% post_url 2021-04-06-who-am-i %})

If this is your first time here, hello!  At the bottom of this (and every) page are links to lists of posts with certain tags (like [(twin) Parenting]({% link /tags/parenting %})), and to a full list of All Posts Ever.

[Here's]({% post_url 2021-04-05-is-this-thing-on %}) a kind of introduction to the blog and [here's]({% post_url 2021-04-06-who-am-i %}) a kind of introduction to me and the sort of thing you might find here.

If you would like to comment on/discuss anything you read here, or else communicate with me through the medium of limited characters, [you can find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpnParenthesis).

Otherwise, come on in, grab a cup of tea (and at least three biscuits) and consider yourself very welcome :)

xx
